# GLA_with_ROSM
In this project, we introduce the Generalised Latent Assimilation (GLA) approach which can be used in Machine learning surrogate modelling for dynamical systems 
The reportory including python scripts for reduced-order-modelling (POD, 1D CAE and POD AE), LSTM (inside the latent space with preprocessing) and GLA (with non-linear high dimensional transformation operators)

The CFD data for one simulation (Um = 0.52) is given in the data reportory.
These data can used to train the ROM and the LSTM using the scripts in these folders respectively
